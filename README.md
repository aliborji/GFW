# GFW: Generated Faces in the Wild

**Generated Faces in the Wild (GFW)** is a comprehensive dataset used to conduct a quantitative comparison of faces generated by multiple image generation models, including **Stable Diffusion**, **Midjourney**, and **DALL-E**. This dataset contains a large number of generated images alongside annotated bounding boxes that define the locations of faces within the images.

The goal of the dataset is to provide an in-depth analysis of the quality, diversity, and accuracy of faces generated by these popular AI-based image generation models.

## Dataset Overview

This dataset compares and evaluates the performance of several image generation models, namely:

- **Stable Diffusion**
- **Midjourney**
- **DALL-E**

The GFW dataset includes:

- **Generated Images**: A large collection of images generated by Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.
- **Annotated Faces**: For each image, bounding boxes are provided to annotate the locations of faces within the images.

## Purpose

The dataset serves as a valuable resource for comparing and analyzing:

- The quality of generated faces by different models.
- The ability of models to accurately place faces within the generated images.
- The diversity of faces generated by each model across various categories.

Researchers and practitioners can use this dataset to evaluate how these models perform in terms of realistic face generation, facial diversity, and alignment with typical human characteristics.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Models Compared**: The dataset includes images generated by Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E. Each model's performance is compared in terms of the quality and diversity of faces generated.
- **Bounding Box Annotations**: Each generated face is annotated with bounding boxes, providing accurate coordinates of face locations in the images. This makes it possible to perform further analysis on the placement, alignment, and proportion of faces.
- **Large Dataset**: The dataset provides a substantial number of images for comprehensive comparisons and evaluations. The large number of faces allows for a robust quantitative analysis.

## Use Cases

This dataset can be utilized for various purposes:

1. **Face Detection Research**: Researchers working on face detection and recognition can use this dataset to test and benchmark face detection algorithms on AI-generated images.
2. **Model Performance Evaluation**: The dataset is valuable for comparing the performance of different image generation models, especially in terms of realism and accuracy of face generation.
3. **Face Generation Quality Analysis**: The dataset can be used to evaluate how different generative models produce faces with respect to alignment, diversity, and other facial features.
